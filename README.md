# Rhyme Detector

Rhyme Detector is an application that allows users to enter lyrics of songs and see rhymes highlighted. This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It makes calls to a Spring Boot server to highlight rhymes (see <https://github.com/billyhao12/rhyme-detector-backend>).
